# 🧬 BioFlowMaster

**BioFlowMaster** is a modular, guided bioinformatics assistant that helps scientists perform complex molecular analyses — like CRISPR guide RNA design or RNA-Seq workflows — using a clean, step-by-step web interface powered by modern tools.

---

## 🚀 Current Features

### ✅ CRISPR gRNA Design (MVP Complete)
- Accepts either a **gene symbol** (e.g., `TP53`, `NANOG`) or a raw **DNA sequence**
- Automatically fetches coding sequences (CDS) from Ensembl API
- Detects candidate gRNAs (20-mer + NGG PAM)
- Displays matched guides, positions, and PAM sites
- Allows **CSV export** of gRNAs

### ✅ RNA-Seq Workflow (Scaffolded)
- Placeholder wizard displaying steps for:
  - FASTQ upload
  - Quality control (FastQC)
  - Trimming (Trimmomatic)
  - Alignment (STAR)
  - Expression analysis (DESeq2)
